But if we look at the positive side, it can be really nice when kids are helpful and do things for you. Like, I remember a few times that my little sisters would help me or carry things for me when I was tired. Or like I remember how I would help my older siblings in a lot of ways when I was a little kid. And when my daughter was a baby, she would also make a lot of helpful things for me, like she would bring me some of my shoes or she would help me cut up some vegetables, or she would bring me a blanket and then just cuddle with me on the couch.
